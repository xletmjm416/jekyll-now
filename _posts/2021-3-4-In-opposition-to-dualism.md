I would like to argue in opposition to dualism, that is, the division of the world into the physical and the abstract, and in favour of what could be called physical monism.

Firstly, primitive dualism separates *mind and body*. It seems evident to me that information encoded in an arrangement of atoms, in words on a page in neurons of the human brain, is as much part of physical reality as what we recognize as atoms, molecules, rocks and stars. It would be misrecognition to assume an existence of an additional plane of existence beyond the universe that we categorize as physical; misrecognition of the fact that arrangement of objects has a physical reality. After all, information about ourselves, our memories, our personalities, the language we speak, should, in principle, be recoverable from body. We already have the sufficient evidence of the physicality of our thoughts as
1. our bodies being part of the physical wholly,
2. our thoughts being stored in our nervous system.

We may never have  a technological device that accomplishes this task of retrieving useful information from a human brain, but we already have the proof of the feasibility of such a program; we perform it ourselves.

Another category of objects that seem to fit dualist point of view are dubbed *shared knowledge*. Objects like language, or mathematics; ones that are proposed to exist independent of their human expression as utterances of proofs. In the naturalist view they really do have physical, local existence within each of us separately, and none beyond that. The proofs beyond those proven, in that light, do not exist, in the same manner of non-existence as utterances that are not part of any language. This last sentence is to be taken as a sort of enumeration of properties that 'existence' does not have.

Further, there are measurable physical quantities that are *collective*. Things like waves, ant colonies, clouds. They exist by the virtue of categorization. They are separated from other objects by the recognition of a pattern. Reductionism proposes their non-existence, in light of them being reducible into microscopic parts. But in light of the previous point, these things do not exist, because we would expect existence to be **continuous** in time; things do not pop in and out of existence. Consider this an axiom, a condition that 'existence' must satisfy.

Consider quantum field theory, where particles have lost the continuity of existence. The expectation of continuity of existence has simply been shifted to fields, and they are now not decaying nor created. This amounts to saying, 'particles do not exist in the sense we understand existence. Fields do, though.' Even worse, continuity of existence *in time* has been shifted into continuity of existence *in causal relationship*, by the virtue of applying special relativity. Had a new theory emerged, such in which fields are excitations of some sort super-fields, it is somewhat conceptually required that we keep those super-fields continuously existing, as the mechanics of their disappearance and appearance would have to be explained by a new entity, hopefully now an eternally (in causal sense) existing one.
